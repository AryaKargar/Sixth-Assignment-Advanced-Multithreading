# Theoretical Questions

### Atomic Variables

- The output will be the same for the *Atomic Counter* each time at 2000000 but Normal Counter will vary between one and two million. This is because atomicCounter is updated with a thread-safe operation but normalCounter is using `normalCounter++` which is non-thread-safe and causes **race condition** .
- The purpose of AtomicInteger is that it is safely updated the shared data in lock free condition without casing race condition .
- The atomicity of counter makes the read & write operations occur at one single step , this system works in a lock free place because it uses low level hardware instructions .
- Atomic variables are better for simple operations on single variables *But* locks would be better for coordinating complex logics .
- AtomicBoolean , AtomicInteger , AtomicLong , AtomicIntegerArray and some other simple data types are available . there are some reference types too like : AtomicReference\<V\> , AtomicReferenceArray\<E\> and so on .



### Pi (Ï€) Estimation - Monte Carlo Algorithm

- No, in my case the multi-thread version was never faster than the single-threaded one. It can have different reasons:
1. Creating threads and managing them can add more work than usual.
2. Scheduling task and switching between them can case more weight than the performance benefits.
- It would be best not to use threads for small tasks, or at least now giving small tasks to each thread and putting more work each one instead of making maximum amount of threads.
